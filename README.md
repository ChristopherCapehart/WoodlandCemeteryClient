- App fetches from https://woodlandcemeteryapi.illusion705.repl.co/data/regular_lots
- Single grave route needs to be added to the API

## Deliverables
- index.html is the map HTML document
- areas.html is the lot area HTML
- .gitignore defines files that won't be pushed to Github
- map.jpg is the map image
- script.js is the JavaScript
- style.css is the CSS
- jquery.maphilight.js is an imported library
- .html is the map code that we developed

## Updating Records
- Data is pulled directly from this Google spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TMlB6OfVMGAKSmMoX_FL42b7g6ai8y7C_q0lcAxr-1E/edit
- The spreadsheet must remain in its current format for the code to work
- Editing the data should automatically update the website
- ID's for FindAGrave and Sketchfab can be found in the URL's

## Future Tasks
- Host on DigitalOcean
- Find a way to plot section D (single graves)
- Plot the rest of the single grave sections
